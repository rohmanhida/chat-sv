Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
